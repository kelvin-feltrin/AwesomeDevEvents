The "AwesomeDevEvents" is an REST API project about programming events. It's possible to create, list, update and delete events and speakers. 

The system can be used with Swagger interface, and the project uses ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Swagger and AutoMapper. The data is stored using a connection to a SQL Server database and migrations to generate the tables.
